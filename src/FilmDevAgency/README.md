## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FilmDevAgency.git
cd FilmDevAgency
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

### 🎯 Running the Application

Launch the application with:
```bash
python agency.py
```

This will start the Gradio interface where you can interact with the agency.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Error: "OpenAI API rate limit exceeded"
   - Solution: Reduce the frequency of requests or upgrade your API plan

2. **Token Limits**
   - Error: "Request too large for gpt-3.5-turbo"
   - Solution: The conversation history is too long. Start a new session

3. **Tavily API Connection Issues**
   - Error: "Failed to resolve 'api.tavily.com'"
   - Solution: Check your internet connection and verify your Tavily API key

4. **Import Errors**
   - Error: "ModuleNotFoundError"
   - Solution: Ensure you're in the virtual environment and all dependencies are installed

### 🪖 Work in Progress

1. ~~Notebook that the team of agents can share and use to collaborate~~
2. A way to save files and documents the agents create


### 📋 Best Practices

1. Always use a virtual environment
2. Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
3. Monitor your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits
4. Regularly update your dependencies

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file
- Keep your API keys confidential
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Add `.env` and `__pycache__` to your `.gitignore`
